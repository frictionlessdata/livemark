# Data Journalism

Livemark has been created with a focus on data journalism. It provides a complete toolset for working with data, starting from data extraction and ending with a publushed website containing interactive charts, tables, and other features.

## Example

COVID-19 Tracker by Frictionless Data is written in Livemark:

> https://convid-tracker.frictionlessdata.io/

```yaml image
path: ../../assets/covid-tracker.png
width: 100%
height: unset
class: border
```

## Prerequisites

Create a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
$ python3 -m venv .python
$ source .python/bin/activate
```

And install livemark:

```
$ pip install livemark
```

## Quick Start

Livemark requires only a few steps from zero to a published project:

First of all, create:
- `livemark.yaml`
- `index.md`
- `pages/data.md` (for example)

Fill in your configuration file:

> livemark.yaml

```yaml
brand:
  text: My Project
about:
  text: My project is for data journalism
site:
  favicon: assets/favicon.ico
github:
  user: <user>
  repo: <repo>
topics:
  selector: h2
links:
  items:
    - name: About Me
      path: https://personal.site
pages:
  items:
    - name: Introduction
      path: index
    - path: pages/data
```

Run a livereload server locally:

```bash
$ livemark start
```

If you do like it, commit the changes and push it to Github. The only missing part now is enabling Github Pages:

> https://guides.github.com/features/pages/

```yaml image
path: ../../assets/deploy.png
width: 75%
height: unset
class: border
```

After this step your documentation portal will be up and running.

## Data Collection

Livemark ships with a builtin task runner. You can have your tasks written down in your article for a better reproducibility as well as be able of running them.

> data.md

```
'''bash task id=data-extract
echo 'Data Extract'
'''
'''python task id=data-transform
print('Data Transform')
'''
'''python task id=data-load
print('Data Load')
'''
```

Use this command to get a list of avalable tasks:

```bash
$ livemark run
```
```
data-extract
data-transform
data-load
```

Execute all of the data tasks:

```bash
$ livemark run data
```
```
Data Extract
Data Transform
Data Load
```

Or run an arbitrary task:

```bash
$ livemark run data-load
```
```
Data Load
```

## Data Visualizations

Livemark provides many ways of visualizing differnt kinds of data. For example, you can add a chart using a corresponding feature:

```yaml
'''yaml chart
data:
  url: ../../data/cars.csv
mark: circle
selection:
  brush:
    type: interval
# other options are omitted
width: 500
height: 300
'''
```

```yaml chart
data:
  url: ../../data/cars.csv
mark: circle
selection:
  brush:
    type: interval
encoding:
  x:
    type: quantitative
    field: kmpl
    scale:
     domain: [12,25]
  y:
    type: quantitative
    field: price
    scale:
     domain: [100,900]
  color:
    condition:
      selection: brush
      field: type
      type: nominal
    value: grey
  size:
    type: quantitative
    field: bhp
width: 500
height: 300
```
