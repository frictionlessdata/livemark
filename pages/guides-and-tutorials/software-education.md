# Software Education

Livemark is perfectly suited for writing education materials as it uses code execution model in markdown documents. This means that as an author you only need to write code snippet inputs while outputs will be automatically inserted into your articles. It solves a range of problems with testing and having your code examples up-to-date. Currently, we're working on providing a guide and a real-word example for Software Education with Livemark.
