# Using Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. You use Markdown to write documents in your Livemark projects. With Livemark you can use all the base Markdown features along side with ones added by Github and Livemark itself.

## Base Markdown

Base Markdown functionality includes:

- Headings
- Text styles
- Syntax Highlighting
- Horizontal Rule
- Alignments
- Tables
- Links

There are plenty of great Markdown guides, to name a few:

- [Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ultimate-markdown-cheat-sheet-3d3976b31a0)

We encourage you to learn Markdown first to use it in Livemark.
